My chosen representation of self is an interactive annotated digital CV (Curriculum Vitae.) My intention was to create a minimalist, bare-bones online CV using html, and then to use hyperlinks to incorporate annotations and external links, creating a director’s cut/commentary of the CV. 

<p>To me, the CV is the ultimate symbol of feeling like a professional, or at least functional, adult, and nothing feels as genuinely (if duplicitously) autobiographical as updating my CV with new experiences. As someone who has spent the majority of my professional, personal, and academic life walking the line between creative/creator and academic/researcher (possibly converging at a 3rd point with archivist/curator), the interactive CV is a way for me to embody my various interests and pursuits in digital space.

<p>When I first began approaching professional spaces and serious academia, I felt behind and out of place. Over the course of years of reading self help books, paying attention to self presentation, networking, volunteering, and eventually working in the professional world, I came to look very good on paper. Whenever I update my resume, I am reminded of the little omissions or embellishments I make in this format, I remember my past experiences and spin them in a rosy light, and I often wish (or worry) that the truth and contexts of my experiences could show through the cracks of this professional document. In constructing this honest resume, I have pushed myself to reflect on my experiences in a way that is accurate to how I feel, not just attractive to potential employers, and engage creative techniques I rarely deem appropriate to list on my resume. Ultimately, I am proud, humbled, and embarrassed by/of this not-quite-finished work (I hope to use this template as a living document to further build upon.)

<p>I am the things I make with my hands. I am the stories I keep but do not tell. Digital space is intangible in many ways, and I grappled with this by using physical storytelling mediums and by typing out my own html. Digital space is a workspace, a playground, and a horizon. In a mediated, computerized world, I am my own experiences. I am what I look like on paper, what I sound like in the world, where I’ve been, and where I can go. I am flirtations and approximations. I am mistakes and pretensions and missteps and misspoken/mistyped words. I am small victories and gradual change. I don’t know if I’m a “culture” or a “gender” or even an “identity,” but I am a history.
